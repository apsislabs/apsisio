        <h2>Working at Apsis</h2>
        <p>Apsis Labs is a small design &amp; development company.  Our headquarters is in Seattle, WA but we work as a fully distributed team.  We offer retirement and health benefits, a competitive salary, an unlimited vacation policy, and a 20-hour work week.</p>
        <p>We are currently hiring a <a href="/jobs/software-developer">software developer</a> and a <a href="/jobs/project-business-manager">project/business manager</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="diversity">Diversity</h3>
        <p>We are currently a team of six white men, an unsurprising result since until now we have hired mostly through word of mouth.  We do not want to stay that way!  We are committed to building a diverse, welcoming, and respectful workplace, and we encourage applications from all genders, races, ages, and backgrounds.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Tech bro&rdquo; culture is anathema to us.</p>

        <h3 id="faq">FAQ</h3>
        <p><strong>Is it really a 20-hour work week?</strong><br />Yes.  We only work 20 hours a week, whether it's billable or non-billable work.</p>
        <p><strong>How much do you pay?</strong><br />We consider this a full-time job, so we offer a full-time salary and benefits.  We don't try to compete with Amazon or Facebook on salary, but we're around the median for software developers as a whole.</p>
        <p><strong>How much travel do you require?</strong><br />No travel is ever required.  If you're able to travel, we will invite you to (1) visit one of our major clients sometime during your first year, and (2) attend our annual team + family retreat.</p>
