### The Challenge

When [Heritage Appraisers](https://heritageappraisers.com/) experienced a sudden breakup with their previous development agency, they found themselves with a limited access to critical credentials and source code. The platform, vital to their business operations, needed a complete recovery to bring it back online and a strategy to protect against future disruptions. Heritage wanted not only a quick fix but a partner they could trust to build long-term stability.

That’s where Apsis Labs stepped in.

### The Solution

**1\. Immediate Recovery and Secure Relaunch**
Apsis Labs moved quickly to recover Heritage’s platform. Our team decrypted and restored the application, then relaunched it on reliable new hardware. Built on Ruby on Rails and hosted on Amazon AWS, the site gained a robust, flexible infrastructure capable of handling Heritage’s unique needs. This setup brought Heritage back online securely and set the stage for a more efficient, scalable solution moving forward.

**2\. Establishing Client Ownership and Transparency**
With our “be easy to hire and easier to fire” motto in mind, Apsis Labs worked closely with Heritage to ensure that all essential accounts, credentials, and permissions were transferred directly to their team. This transparent approach restored Heritage’s full ownership of their platform, eliminating the dependency on any one agency and empowering them to manage their resources with confidence.

**3\. Long-term Modernization and Support**
Over the past four years, Apsis Labs has worked continuously with Heritage to evolve and improve their platform. We’ve modernized the backend, optimized site performance, and implemented cost-effective changes to the AWS infrastructure—all while ensuring HIPAA and security compliance. By maintaining and updating their Ruby on Rails application, Apsis Labs has created a foundation for future growth that’s both cost-efficient and performance-driven.

**4\. Building Trust through Reliability and Communication**
Trust is central to our relationship with Heritage. Regular updates, proactive communication, and dependable support have helped restore confidence between stakeholders and developers. Heritage’s platform is now not only stable and secure but also equipped to handle new features and growing traffic, providing a seamless experience for their users.
