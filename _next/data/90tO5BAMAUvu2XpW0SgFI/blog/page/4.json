Every industry has fascinating hurdles that are\ncompletely unknown to the outside world, and software allows us to build a catapult\nto hurl ourselves over them, if we take the time to map the terrain first.\nLearning the landscape from domain experts is always a rich experience.\nDelivering a catapult that meets their actual needs is a fitting reward.\n\n\nBeyond the office, you'll find Henry reading, gardening, or playing strategy\ngames with family. Any physical catapults in the backyard are strictly\ncoincidental.\n","bio_short":"An imported Coloradan, Henry sees software as a tool to bridge industries.\nHe loves collaborating with domain experts to map the terrain, then building\nsolutions that meet their real-world needs.\n","social":[{"network":"linkedin","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/henrykeiter/"},{"network":"blog","link":"/blog/people/henry"},{"network":"github","link":"https://github.com/henrykeiter"}]},"layout":"post","author":"henry","title":"Number One Employee","image":"/img/posts/pikes-peak.jpg","date":"2016-02-01","excerpt":"<p>A few years out of undergrad, I was finally getting comfortable with life in the Real World.
