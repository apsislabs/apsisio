        Noah is a founding partner of Apsis Labs and the kind
        of crazy person who likes digging through a brand new
        code-base. When he's not doing software development
        things, he can be found trying to get better at making
        things up (improv) and playing sports (football and
        rugby).

        Henry is an eldritch horror, bound to an interdimensional
        coding machine until his blood debt is repaid in full.
        His original job title was Spider Wrangler, but he requested
        a transfer after the first day. It was not granted.

        Eric is generalist software developer who can crawl through
        SQL optimizations, or match a front-end to a design document.
