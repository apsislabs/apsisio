Oh hey. It's been a while. Maybe too long, I guess. 6 years? Really?

Wow.

Hard to believe we're 10 years old[^1]. That's double digits. I remember turning double digits (in real life); it was made out to be a big deal.

If you care, let me catch you up on what's happened. We didn't go quiet for no reason --- in fact, the narrative of why we stopped posting to this blog is pretty straightforward: we made a classic small-business blunder, and we over indexed on a single client. We put ~~all~~ 83% of our eggs in one basket, and then all of a sudden, that basket got yanked. What ensued was probably predictable: we tried (and failed) to find new clients, we tried (and failed) to generate revenue with side projects. We went through layoffs. We got small. We got quiet. We survived.

And mostly, we turned it around. We did find new clients. We worked on cool new projects. We hired back some of those people we'd had to lay off. We hired new people too. Along with the rest of the world, we weathered a pandemic, and mostly, we've kept going.

So why am I writing here again?

Well, while we were working, we passed that milestone I mentioned earlier, and it's made us think a lot. About our work, our lives, our commitment to the project of sustainable creative work. We've been talking a lot about what we want out of the next 10 years --- what does Apsis look like in 2034? Does it look like anything?

We hope the answer is yes: but we sincerely don't know. We don't know, because a lot like writing code, running a team --- running a business --- is a creative endeavor. Creative, as in creating something that wasn't here yesterday. We think tomorrow we'll wake up and the spark will be there, but it's impossible to know. All we know is it was here today.
