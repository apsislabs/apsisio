engineering team. In stark contrast to his cofounder, Noah’s history is
about as textbook as it gets: CS classes at the University of Oregon while
still in high school, BS from the University of Washington with
specialization in physics and computer science, a stint at Microsoft, a tour
at Amazon, and for the last decade plus, serving as Apsis’s lead engineer
and architect. Noah’s drive for building the technically correct solution is
balanced by his decade of experience running Apsis Labs, where his focus is on
outcome-driven-development: finding the solution that delivers 90% of the value
at 10% of the effort.</p>
<p>Outside of work, you’ll find Noah with his wife, dog, and two young children;
or you’ll find him working, but this time on a new GUI layout engine in Rust or
perhaps trying to get his video drivers to work correctly — he runs Linux after
all.</p>

exceptional engineers, one equipped to deliver effective solutions fast.
After more than a decade, Wyatt <em>keeps</em> coming back to software because it
offers a rare convergence of interests: writing, teaching, and tech.
A graduate of Bennington College in Vermont, Wyatt’s appreciation for clear
communication has come to define Apsis’s engineering team: understanding first,
technology second. This focus leads to asking the right questions, finding the
right answers, and delivering success year after year.</p>
<p>After work, you’ll find Wyatt enjoying time with his wife and daughter, playing
