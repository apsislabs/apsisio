These are the actions that will actually be handled by a reducer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The asynchronous action creator will have to accept some number of arguments in order to create the promise---in this example, it was just the name of the subreddit---and these arguments should also passed along to the reducer as part of the action object.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The promise is returned to the code calling dispatch, in case it needs to chain some logic of its own.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Those observations lead us to a helper function---I suppose you could call it an asynchronous action creator <em>creator</em>---that looks like this:</p>\n<div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>function</span> <span>promiseAction</span><span>(</span><span>type<span>,</span> createPromise</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>\n    <span>const</span> actionTypes <span>=</span> <span>{</span>\n        <span>START</span><span>:</span> type <span>+</span> <span>'_START'</span><span>,</span>\n        <span>SUCCESS</span><span>:</span> type <span>+</span> <span>'_SUCCESS'</span><span>,</span>\n        <span>ERROR</span><span>:</span> type <span>+</span> <span>'_ERROR'</span>\n    <span>}</span>\n\n    <span>const</span> <span>actionCreator</span> <span>=</span> <span>args</span> <span>=></span> <span>(</span><span>dispatch<span>,</span> getState</span><span>)</span> <span>=></span> <span>{</span>\n        <span>dispatch</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>type</span><span>:</span> actionTypes<span>.</span><span>START</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span>args <span>}</span><span>)</span>\n        <span>return</span> <span>createPromise</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>state</span><span>:</span> <span>getState</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span>args <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span>\n            <span>result</span> <span>=></span> <span>dispatch</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>type</span><span>:</span> actionTypes<span>.</span><span>SUCCESS</span><span>,</span> result<span>,</span> <span>...</span>args <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>\n            <span>error</span> <span>=></span> <span>dispatch</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>type</span><span>:</span> actionTypes<span>.</span><span>ERROR</span><span>,</span> error<span>,</span> <span>...</span>args <span>}</span><span>)</span>\n        <span>)</span>\n    <span>}</span>\n\n    <span>return</span> <span>[</span>actionTypes<span>,</span> actionCreator<span>]</span>\n<span>}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now the action definition from the example can be written with almost no boilerplate:</p>\n<div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>[</span><span>FETCH_POSTS</span><span>,</span> fetchPosts<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>promiseAction</span><span>(</span><span>'FETCH_POSTS'</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span><span>{</span> subreddit <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=></span> <span>{</span>\n    <span>return</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>http://www.reddit.com/r/</span><span><span>${</span>subreddit<span>}</span></span><span>.json</span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span>\n        <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>response</span> <span>=></span> response<span>.</span><span>json</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>\n        <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>json</span> <span>=></span> <span>(</span><span>{</span>\n            <span>posts</span><span>:</span> json<span>.</span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>children</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>child</span> <span>=></span> child<span>.</span><span>data</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>\n            <span>receivedAt</span><span>:</span> <span>Date</span><span>.</span><span>now</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>\n        <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>\n<span>}</span><span>)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>A few notes on the implementation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>We pass the state into the promise creator.  This makes it possible to implement logic like executing an HTTP request only if the resource hasn't already been loaded (see the subsequent <code>fetchPostsIfNeeded</code> example from the redux docs) without creating an additional thunk.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The asynchronous action creator is called with object-style arguments rather than an argument list, so they can be passed along as named properties of the synchronous action objects.  Calling code looks like <code>dispatch(createPost({ author, content }))</code>  instead of <code>dispatch(createPost(author, content))</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We export the three action types as a single object with <code>START</code>, <code>SUCCESS</code>, and <code>ERROR</code> properties instead of exporting three separate strings.  This is really just to have shorter import statements in the reducer.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I like this kind of helper because it makes our code less repetitive while keeping the simplicity of the original.  No new dependencies are added, no new abstractions need to be learned; we just extract a pattern which was already present.</p>\n<h2 id=\"user-content-footnote-label\">Footnotes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-1\">\n<p>Of course, you can't always write code in order of execution, but when you have a few statements like: parse this JSON, then extract these properties, then set a timestamp; <em>which are always executed together and in that order,</em> it seems silly not to. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-1\" aria-label=\"Back to content\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"user-content-user-content-fn-2\">\n<p>If you are willing to increase complexity, there are certainly dependencies that you can introduce!  For example, <a href=\"https://github.com/acdlite/redux-promise\">redux-promise</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/pburtchaell/redux-promise-middleware\">redux-promise-middleware</a> each implement middleware that allow you to dispatch promises directly.  They also use <a href=\"https://github.com/acdlite/flux-standard-action\">flux standard actions</a>, so that's another small standard you'll need to learn.  You may be disappointed if their choice of abstraction does not line up with what you need.  redux-promise does not dispatch a starting action so you'll probably end up using it in combination with redux-thunk.  redux-promise-middleware has gone through four major versions, changing its interface a bit each time.  Neither exposes application state. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-2\" aria-label=\"Back to content\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n","author":"niall","layout":"post","title":"Asynchronous Action Creators in Redux","image":"/img/posts/clocke.jpg","excerpt":"<p>Redux applications often use the <a href=\"https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk\">redux-thunk</a> middleware to dispatch actions for interacting with an HTTP API.
