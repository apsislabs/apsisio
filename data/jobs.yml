    Seeking a skilled Frontend-focused Full Stack Engineer who
    thrives on building beautiful and functional user interfaces,
    but still feels comfortable on the server.

    While we're looking for developers with strong technical skills
    we typically don't hire for experience in a particular framework
    or technology. We're mostly seeking generalists that enjoy working
    in new technical stacks and have exceptional communication: because
    we're a small company, everyone here takes on a lot of roles,
    and strong relationships with our clients is absolutely essential
    to our success.

    We offer a 20-hour work week, retirement and health benefits, a
    competitive salary, an unlimited vacation and parental leave policy.
    At Apsis, you'll have the opportunity to contribute meaningfully
    throughout the entire development lifecycle, from initial concept
    to polished product. We believe in sustainable work practices,
    detailed on [our mission statement](/mission).
