over 10 years, Noah has been the technical backbone of the Apsis
engineering team. In stark contrast to his cofounder, Noah&#8217;s history is
about as textbook as it gets: CS classes at the University of Oregon while
still in high school, BS from the University of Washington with
specialization in physics and computer science, a stint at Microsoft, a tour
at Amazon, and for the last decade plus, serving as Apsis&#8217;s lead engineer
and architect. Noah&#8217;s drive for building the technically correct solution is
balanced by his decade of experience running Apsis Labs, where his focus is on
outcome-driven-development: finding the solution that delivers 90% of the value
at 10% of the effort.</p>
<p>Outside of work, you&#8217;ll find Noah with his wife, dog, and two young children;
or you&#8217;ll find him working, but this time on a new GUI layout engine in Rust or
perhaps trying to get his video drivers to work correctly &mdash; he runs Linux after
all.</p>
