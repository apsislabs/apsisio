### The Challenges

In the world of healthcare, managing prior authorizations and benefits investigations is complex and highly regulated. Our client [careviso](https://www.careviso.com) — a health tech startup focused on improving access to diagnostic testing—needed a robust, secure platform to support their growing prior-authorization team as they processed thousands of insurance requests. They needed a platform that could not only automate routine tasks and scale with their growth, but also meet the strict requirements of HIPAA and SOC 2 compliance.

With these priorities in mind, they partnered with Apsis Labs to build an efficient, reliable, and secure platform from the ground up.


### The Solution

**1\. Building a HIPAA and SOC 2 Compliant Server and Workflow** At Apsis, our first step was to ensure the platform met HIPAA and SOC 2 compliance standards for handling sensitive health data. We built the server in Ruby on Rails and designed a secure, scalable workflow specifically for managing prior authorizations. Our team focused on automating repetitive tasks, such as interacting with health insurance providers, which made the whole system faster and reduced the opportunity for human error.


**2\. Creating Scalable, Compliant Infrastructure with AWS** To support the platform’s growth, we set up a scalable infrastructure solution in AWS using terraform. Managing the infrastructure in code allowed us to maintain reliability and speed. Our work also followed security best practices, crucial for HIPAA and SOC 2 compliance. The platform now handles over 2 million API requests per year (typically large, batch processing requests) without compromising on security or speed.

**3\. Integrating Benefits Investigation Tools** To further support the careviso's process, we built custom integrations to drive a benefits investigation platform. These integrations make it easier to determine patients’ coverage details, eligibility, and costs. All data exchanges follow HIPAA-compliant protocols, ensuring secure transmission and storage of sensitive information.


**4\. Enabling HIPAA-Compliant Data Analysis** With a solid application in place, the next need was to collect detailed insights on prior authorization decisions across hundreds of thousands of cases. Apsis Labs helped to build a big-data solution that allowed the analysis team to identify trends across their data. This analytics platform was designed to handle large volumes of data while ensuring that patient information was protected, in line with HIPAA and SOC 2 standards.

### The Results

Thanks in part to Apsis Labs’ contributions, [careviso](https://www.careviso.com) is now a market leader in prior authorization and benefits investigation. The platform efficiently handles millions of requests annually, giving patients quicker access to critical diagnostic testing. The secure, automated system has saved countless hours for their team, letting them focus on high-impact tasks rather than administrative work.

In addition, our client’s ability to scale rapidly and stay compliant played a role in raising over [**$17 million in Series B funding**](https://www.careviso.com/news-events/careviso-raises-over-17-million-in-series-b-funding-to-enhance-transparency-and-access-for-diagnostic-testing). The combination of reliable infrastructure, efficient workflows, and secure integrations has enabled them to grow with confidence.
