You internally groan because you just got all the infrastructure working correctly, but you start frantically searching how to setup and run Docker and jump right into figuring out how to apply it to your current projects because it needs to be done yesterday.</p>
<p>Before looking into how to setup Docker, let's fill in the basics of what you always wanted to know about Docker but didn't know you needed to ask.</p>
<h2>What is Docker?</h2>
<p>Docker is a tool for developing applications in a virtualized operating system, called a container, which can run on any hardware, guaranteeing that the software runs the same in any environment.</p>
<p>Docker containers allow you to install anything that would normally be installed on a server to run your application into a portable file that can be moved from environment to environment without any need to reinstall the dependencies</p>
