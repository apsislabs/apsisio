  bio: |
    For over 10 years, Noah has been the technical backbone of the Apsis
    engineering team. In stark contrast to his cofounder, Noah's history is
    about as textbook as it gets: CS classes at the University of Oregon while
    still in high school, BS from the University of Washington with
    specialization in physics and computer science, a stint at Microsoft, a tour
    at Amazon, and for the last decade plus, serving as Apsis's lead engineer
    and architect. Noah's drive for building the technically correct solution is
    balanced by his decade of experience running Apsis Labs, where his focus is on
    outcome-driven-development: finding the solution that delivers 90% of the value
    at 10% of the effort.


    Outside of work, you'll find Noah with his wife, dog, and two young children;
    or you'll find him working, but this time on a new GUI layout engine in Rust or
    perhaps trying to get his video drivers to work correctly &mdash; he runs Linux after
    all.

    For over a decade, Noah has led Apsis' engineering team with technical expertise.
    His background is textbook: CS degree from UW, time at Microsoft and Amazon, and
    now 10+ years as Apsis' lead engineer and architect.

    An accidental developer, Wyatt came to software and small business by an
    unconventional route. As a cofounder at Apsis, he has helped build a team of
    exceptional engineers, one equipped to deliver effective solutions fast.

    offers a rare convergence of interests: writing, teaching, and tech.
    A graduate of Bennington College in Vermont, Wyatt's appreciation for clear
    communication has come to define Apsis's engineering team: understanding first,
    technology second. This focus leads to asking the right questions, finding the
    right answers, and delivering success year after year.


    After work, you'll find Wyatt enjoying time with his wife and daughter, playing
    with the cat, roasting coffee, cooking dinner, or arguing on the internet about
    college football.

  bio: |
    Henry is an imported Coloradan who views software development as a window
    into everyone else's fields. Every industry has fascinating hurdles that are
    completely unknown to the outside world, and software allows us to build a catapult
    to hurl ourselves over them, if we take the time to map the terrain first.
    Learning the landscape from domain experts is always a rich experience.
    Delivering a catapult that meets their actual needs is a fitting reward.


    Beyond the office, you'll find Henry reading, gardening, or playing strategy
    games with family. Any physical catapults in the backyard are strictly
    coincidental.
