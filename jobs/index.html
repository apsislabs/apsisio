        <h2>Working at Apsis</h2>
        <p>Apsis Labs is a small design &amp; development company.  Our headquarters is in Seattle, WA but we work as a fully distributed team.  We offer retirement and health benefits, a competitive salary, an unlimited vacation policy, and a 20-hour work week.</p>

        <h3 id="diversity">Diversity</h3>
        <p>We are currently a team of six white men, an unsurprising result since until now we have hired mostly through word of mouth.  We do not want to stay that way!  We are committed to building a diverse, welcoming, and respectful workplace, and we encourage applications from all genders, races, ages, and backgrounds.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Tech bro&rdquo; culture is anathema to us.</p>
