    bio: >
        Co-founder and Creative Director at Apsis Labs,
        Wyatt is your typical English-major turned front-end
        guy turned back-end guy. He hates Javascript, but
        writes it anyway.

    bio: >
        Noah is a founding partner of Apsis Labs and the kind
        of crazy person who likes digging through a brand new
        code-base. When he's not doing software development
        things, he can be found trying to get better at making
        things up (improv) and playing sports (football and
        rugby).

henry:
    name: "Henry Keiter"

    bio: >
        Henry is an eldritch horror, bound to an interdimensional
        coding machine until his blood debt is repaid in full.
        His original job title was Spider Wrangler, but he requested
        a transfer after the first day. It was not granted.

eric:
    name: "Eric Greer"
    image: "people/eric.jpg"
    bio: >
        Eric is generalist software developer who can crawl through
        SQL optimizations, or match a front-end to a design document.
        In his off time from Apsis he is working on running his own
        company.

niall:
    name: "Niall Wingham"
    image: "people/niall.jpg"
    bio: >
        Niall is a cheerful curmudgeon and likes reading language and
        protocol specifications. He lives with his professorial wife
        in Toronto and is by default the head of the Canadian branch
        of Apsis. When he grows up he wants to be a farmer, or maybe
        a ballet dancer, or no, wait, a sailor!

chris:
    name: "Chris Pfohl"
    image: "people/chris.jpg"
    bio: >
        Chris accidentally became a software developer when he realized
        how much he enjoyed his first programming class in college. He's
        never written a tetris clone in Q-Basic, and to date has never
        created a todo app or twitter clone. When he's not working he's
        most likely roasting coffee, brewing beer, or playing a board
        game.
