It&#39;s not fear for the future of our jobs (though there are doomsayers a plenty if you care to listen). Rather, if you&#39;ve worked with us, you&#39;ll know how highly we prize clear communication. Clarity in transmission of meaning is, in many ways, the most fundamental aspect of a programmer&#39;s job: we provide instruction to the machine which cannot help but take all instructions literally. Our role as contractors is not much different: we are often brought in because our clients value our expertise and lack it themselves. They trust us --- hell, they pay us --- to be the liaison between the technical and the non-technical, and to call this current generation of predictive models &quot;AI&quot; betrays that trust.</p>\n<p>See, &quot;AI&quot; conjures HAL 9000 and Skynet, Deep Thought and the Prime Radiant. What it does not do is convey to our clients what is actually happening: a recursive loop of predicting the next word in a sentence based on dubiously procured sources.<sup><a id=\"footnote-ref-1\" href=\"#footnote-1\" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">1</a></sup> A great flattener of the creative into the most or second most likely thought. There are situations in which that is useful, productive, efficient: but there are many more applications in which it is harmful and misleading.
