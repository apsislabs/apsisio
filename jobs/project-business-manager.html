        <h2>Project/Business Manager</h2>
        <p>We are looking for a new team member to help run the non-technical parts of our business.  These responsibilities are currently shared between the software developers on our team, but we think it makes sense to consolidate as many as possible into a job of their own.</p>
        <p>This is a newly created position within a small company, so you will be the only member of our team that is not a software developer.  As such, we are seeking someone who is proactive and self-motivated, and who will be excited to create their own opportunities to grow/shape the non-technical aspects of our business.</p>

        <p>The responsibilities we have in mind for this position include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Project Management</strong><br/>
            Tracking our work across multiple clients and projects, usually with Jira.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Development</strong><br/>
            Looking for opporunities for new projects with our existing clients, and finding new clients.</li>
            <li><strong>Finance and Administration</strong><br/>
            Managing payroll, reimbursements, and the general paperwork of operating a business.</li>
            <li><strong>Social</strong><br/>
            Helping to organize our annual team &amp; family retreat, and other initiatives.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These responsibilities will likely evolve with your input and as our company grows.</p>

        <h3>Interview Process</h3>
        <p>Our standard process will be one phone interview and a final onsite interview in Seattle.  Since we have not hired for a position like this before, we may customize the process based on the individual applying.</p>
        <p>In the interviews, we will assess experience you have claimed on your resume, your knowledge of software development lifecycles and methodologies, and your ability to manage client relationships.</p>
        <p>We will also encourage you to ask questions about our business, and to propose how you think you can best fill this role and what your strengths in this position would be.</p>

        <h3>Apply</h3>
        <p>We are committed to building a diverse, welcoming, and respectful workplace, and we encourage applications from all genders, races, ages, and backgrounds.</p>
        <p>To apply, please complete this <a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">application form</a>.</p>
