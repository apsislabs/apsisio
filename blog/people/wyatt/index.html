unconventional route. As a cofounder at Apsis, he has helped build a team of
exceptional engineers, one equipped to deliver effective solutions fast.
After more than a decade, Wyatt <em>keeps</em> coming back to software because it
offers a rare convergence of interests: writing, teaching, and tech.
A graduate of Bennington College in Vermont, Wyatt&#8217;s appreciation for clear
communication has come to define Apsis&#8217;s engineering team: understanding first,
technology second. This focus leads to asking the right questions, finding the
right answers, and delivering success year after year.</p>
<p>After work, you&#8217;ll find Wyatt enjoying time with his wife and daughter, playing
with the cat, roasting coffee, cooking dinner, or arguing on the internet about
college football.</p>
