title: We're Hiring

We’re hiring and we want you to join us.

Often times, careers software engineering are built around what we see as burnout-culture: crunch time is all the time. We believe work should one part of a *healthy* and *sustainable* life; one where what you do professionally sustains you as much as what you do for fun. To better achieve that goal, we offer a unique work environment, including:

* _A 20-hour work week_. While you will be considered a full-time employee, we won't ask for more than 20 hours of your time each week. What you do with the rest is up to you.
* Unlimited paid vacation time, with a mandatory minimum of 3 weeks per year.
* Remote Work, or a sweet desk in our Seattle office.

Sound interesting? You can read more about [our philosophy on work]({% post_url 2015-04-23-work-sustainably %}), or check out our job listings below. If you think you’d be awesome at any of the positions please send an email to [jobs@apsis.io](mailto:jobs@apsis.io) with your resume — or CV, we take those too — along with anything else you think we might want to see (Github, portfolio, sweet flash game).
